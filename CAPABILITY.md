# MirrorMe BPX Quadruped

The published package identity exposes
`robonix/primitive/quadruped/odom` and
`robonix/primitive/quadruped/posture`. Its SDK runtime owns one
`MotionLevelControl` instance but exposes only exact `stand` and `sit` RPCs;
velocity mode remains disabled and it does not create or declare `twist_in`.
The explicit SDK read-only and normalized-replay profiles expose only odom.

An explicitly non-release `motion_dev` package identity keeps the guarded fake
Twist path available for offline safety tests. It is not a supported hardware
capability and must not be submitted to the Robonix Package Catalog as a
release variant.

An isolated, explicitly confirmed hardware probe now owns one
`MotionLevelControl` object and supports only a bounded
`setStandUp()` -> three-second hold -> `setSitDown()` cycle. A distinct,
hardware-test-only package identity also exposes the same two commands as the
Robonix `posture` RPC with state feedback, serialization, timeouts, and
bounded failure cleanup. The validated stand/sit seam is also the production
posture implementation. A second
manually confirmed probe uses `setVelocity(0, 0, yaw)` only for one bounded,
LegOdom-closed-loop yaw circle between stand and sit. Only feedback in the
commanded direction counts toward completion; bounded opposite-direction,
translation, timeout, and interruption failures zero yaw and attempt to sit.
It is likewise absent from every manifest. A general `setVelocity(x, y, yaw)`
adapter is the intended implementation behind `twist_in`, but that Robonix
path is deferred.
`JointLevelControl` will not be integrated.

All runtimes publish the internal ROS 2 `/joint_states` topic with the 12 names
defined by the pinned BPX SDK and official URDF. This topic is not advertised
as a Robonix capability because no quadruped JointState contract exists in the
fixed baseline.

Current restrictions:

- Mapping, localization, autonomous navigation, obstacle avoidance, lidar and
  camera perception are outside the BPX product scope; odometry is body-state
  feedback and does not imply navigation support.
- Activation never moves the robot. Production use of `backend=sdk` loads a
  separately mounted, checksum-verified v1.0.8 wheel and enables only the
  stand/sit posture service with `allow_motion=true` and
  `enable_posture_service=true`.
- The explicit SDK read-only profile constructs `RequestRobotState` only with
  `allow_motion=false`; the posture-test identity additionally requires local
  acknowledgement.
- `backend=replay` requires an absolute versioned JSONL path, remains read-only,
  and preserves recorded freshness and disconnect events.
- Unknown, non-finite, stale or out-of-state commands are rejected or reduced
  to a strict zero command.
- Flip, running, jumping, handstand and low-level joint control are not exposed.
- Bounded move and continuous twist contracts are not declared by a release
  manifest. Posture supports only `stand` and `sit`.
- JointState effort is omitted until the SDK torque unit is confirmed.
