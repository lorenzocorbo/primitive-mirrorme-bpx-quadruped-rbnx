# MirrorMe BPX Quadruped Robonix Primitive

Safety-first Robonix adapter for the MirrorMe BPX quadruped. The release
surface publishes odometry and exact `stand`/`sit` posture RPCs through one
SDK owner. The repository also contains a strictly read-only SDK profile,
normalized state replay, and a non-release fake-motion profile. It does not
include or redistribute the BPX SDK.

The SDK baseline is v1.0.8, pinned to public repository commit
`cab478a5fd3dfce087e0774534bb87b51a3d69e1`. Download the CPython 3.10 Linux
x86_64 wheel from the fixed
[`v1.0.8` release](https://github.com/mirrormerobotics/bpx_sdk_open/releases/tag/v1.0.8),
then pass its local path through `BPX_SDK_WHEEL`. The adapter does not follow
the moving `master` HEAD implicitly.

## Current capability surface

- Release manifests (`package_manifest.yaml` and
  `package_manifest.x86-docker.yaml`): odom plus the `posture` RPC, restricted
  to exact `stand` and `sit` names.
- Explicit SDK read-only manifest: `robonix/primitive/quadruped/odom` only.
- Replay profile: `robonix/primitive/quadruped/odom` only.
- Non-release `package_manifest.motion-dev.yaml`: fake backend only, with
  `robonix/primitive/quadruped/twist_in` and
  `robonix/primitive/quadruped/odom` for offline safety tests.
- Hardware-test-only `package_manifest.posture-test.yaml`: alternate SDK test
  identity with
  `odom` plus the `posture` RPC, restricted to the exact names `stand` and
  `sit` and guarded by an explicit local startup acknowledgement.

The production SDK runtime never creates the `twist_in` subscription. Release
manifests force `backend=sdk`; a later configuration mismatch fails
initialization. The fake command path has a distinct
`robonix.primitive.mirrorme.bpx.quadruped.motion_dev` package identity so it
cannot silently expand the published package's capability surface.

`move` remains absent from every release manifest. `posture` is published
after its Robonix RPC and true-hardware state closure were validated; the
distinct `posture_test` identity remains available for diagnostics.

The initial MotionLevelControl integrations were validated through isolated
hardware-debug probes. The first exposes only `setStandUp()` and
`setSitDown()` for one bounded stand/hold/sit cycle. A second manual probe uses
only `setVelocity(0, 0, yaw)` for an odometry-closed-loop in-place circle. The
validated stand/sit seam is now used by the production posture profile; the
separate `posture_test` identity remains available for diagnostics. The
Robonix `setVelocity(x, y, yaw)` mapping behind `twist_in` remains deferred,
and `JointLevelControl` is out of scope.

BPX does not support mapping, localization, or autonomous navigation. This
Primitive therefore exposes no map, navigation-goal, path-planning, obstacle,
lidar, or camera capability. `odom` is body-state feedback only.

The provider also publishes the standard internal ROS 2 topic
`/joint_states` (`sensor_msgs/JointState`). The fixed SDK index order maps
directly to the 12 names in the official BPX URDF. This stream is deliberately
not declared to Atlas because the fixed Robonix baseline has no quadruped
JointState contract. Position and velocity are published; `effort` remains
empty until the SDK torque unit is confirmed.

## Safety defaults

- The release start entry requires the pinned SDK wheel, forces `backend=sdk`,
  and enables only guarded posture control.
- The generic runtime config still defaults to `fake`, but only the explicitly
  selected motion-development manifest may use that backend.
- `allow_motion` defaults to `false`; production posture configuration must
  explicitly set `allow_motion=true` and `enable_posture_service=true`.
- Activation validates a fresh `LyingDown(0)` or `Motion(6)` state but sends no
  posture command.
- The controlled fake path emits zero for invalid, stale, disconnected,
  deactivated and shutdown states. The production SDK path exposes no velocity
  method and accepts only explicit `stand`/`sit` posture RPCs.
- No code in this package calls `setZeroPositionsFlag()`.

## Offline tests

```bash
bash scripts/test.sh
```

## Docker build

The image uses Ubuntu 22.04 through `ros:humble-ros-base`:

```bash
bash scripts/build-container.sh
```

This builds a test target first and only tags the runtime image after the tests
pass. The default image name is `primitive-mirrorme-bpx-quadruped-rbnx:dev`.
The Robonix wire dependencies are pinned in the image to the versions used by
the fixed Robonix source baseline; `grpcio-tools` remains confined to the
code-generation tool image.

## Verify the fixed SDK wheel

The wheel stays outside this repository. Verification mounts it read-only into
an isolated container and checks the recorded SHA-256 before importing it:

```bash
bash scripts/verify-sdk-wheel.sh /path/to/bpx_sdk_open-1.0.8-cp310-...x86_64.whl
```

For a bounded, state-only hardware capture:

```bash
bash scripts/run-read-only-probe.sh /path/to/the-wheel \
  --robot-ip 10.21.20.1 --duration-s 10
```

The probe constructs `RequestRobotState` only. It never constructs a motion or
joint controller and never calls `setZeroPositionsFlag()`. It reports ready
only after both the TCP session and the first odometry frame are available.
In this document, read-only means there is no actuator-command interface. The
vendor `connect()` sequence still configures state upload and performs the
SDK's built-in robot-time synchronization handshake.

Native Linux Docker should keep the default host networking. Docker Desktop
does not expose the robot's UDP state upload to a host-network container in the
same way; use an explicit bridge-mode UDP mapping for the bounded probe and
recorder:

```bash
BPX_DOCKER_NETWORK_MODE=bridge \
  bash scripts/run-read-only-probe.sh /path/to/the-wheel \
  --robot-ip 192.168.1.237 --robot-state-port 9873 --duration-s 10
```

The selected UDP port must be free on the Docker host. The integrated runtime
also accepts bridge mode. In that topology Atlas must listen on an address
reachable from the Docker bridge, and `BPX_DOCKER_HOST_ADDRESS` must identify
the address the Primitive container uses for Atlas (for the tested nested
Docker Desktop topology, the local Docker bridge gateway). The container
automatically advertises its own bridge IPv4 lifecycle endpoint. Native Linux
Docker should retain the default host-network mode.

The reusable `SdkStateSource` follows the same boundary. Its readiness wait is
bounded, it maps leg odometry/IMU/joints/temperatures/motion/battery telemetry,
and its host freshness timestamp advances only when the BPX odometry timestamp
changes. It intentionally has no command method.

## Explicit stand/hold/sit hardware probe

After the physical E-stop, clear test area, operator presence, robot condition,
and control-source arbitration have been checked, one stand/hold/sit cycle can
be run with the narrow MotionLevelControl probe:

```bash
BPX_DOCKER_NETWORK_MODE=bridge \
  bash scripts/run-posture-cycle-probe.sh /path/to/the-wheel \
    --robot-ip 192.168.1.237 \
    --robot-state-port 9873 \
    --hold-duration-s 3 \
    --confirm-physical-motion
```

Use the default host network instead on native Linux. The wrapper first checks
the pinned wheel checksum and required MotionLevelControl API, then requires a
fresh `LyingDown(0)` state before sending anything. It repeats `setStandUp()`
until `Motion(6)`, verifies that state throughout the three-second hold, and
repeats `setSitDown()` until `LyingDown(0)`. Failure, SIGINT, or SIGTERM after
the stand phase starts triggers a bounded sit-down cleanup before disconnect.

This probe never calls `setVelocity()`, `setZeroPositionsFlag()`, gait or
damping commands, and never constructs `JointLevelControl`. It remains a
manual diagnostic; production posture uses the same narrow SDK seam.

## Robonix posture hardware-test profile

`package_manifest.posture-test.yaml` connects the same narrow stand/sit seam to
`robonix/primitive/quadruped/posture` under a separate diagnostic identity.
The production package publishes the same RPC without the test-only startup
acknowledgement. The diagnostic profile requires all of the following:

- the pinned external SDK wheel;
- `backend=sdk`, `allow_motion=true`, and `enable_posture_service=true`;
- `BPX_CONFIRM_PHYSICAL_POSTURE_SERVICE=I_UNDERSTAND_POSTURE_RPC_CAN_MOVE_BPX`;
- a local operator with the physical E-stop and a clear test area.

The RPC accepts only exact lowercase `stand` and `sit`. Calls are serialized,
each response waits for fresh `MotionState` feedback, and duplicate requests
are idempotent. Activation accepts a fresh `LyingDown(0)` or `Motion(6)` state
without moving. Command failure during a posture transition performs a bounded
sit-down attempt. Deactivate and shutdown disable velocity mode and disconnect
without implicitly changing posture. The profile
does not register `twist_in` or `move`, never enables velocity control, and
does not construct `JointLevelControl`.

## Explicit stand/yaw-circle/stop/sit hardware probe

The separate `scripts/run-yaw-circle-probe.sh` wrapper is for a manually
initiated test only. It stands from `LyingDown(0)`, enables velocity control,
holds linear x/y at exactly zero, and sends a bounded yaw rate until the
unwrapped LegOdom yaw reaches `2*pi` in the commanded direction. It then sends
zero yaw, disables velocity control, flushes zero for two seconds, and sits to
`LyingDown(0)`.

Defaults are `0.5 rad/s`, a `2*pi` target, a 30-second turn timeout, and a
0.15-metre maximum horizontal translation from the standing origin. Feedback
more than 0.2 rad in the direction opposite to the command aborts the cycle.
Negative yaw rate selects the other direction. The adapter hard-caps absolute
yaw at `1.0 rad/s` even though the SDK documents a higher Walk limit.

The vendor C++ example sends `1.0 rad/s` for three seconds, which is about
3 radians rather than a full circle. This probe follows its velocity-enable,
periodic command, zero-flush and sit ordering, but uses odometry closure to
implement the requested full circle. It omits the example's zero-position and
unrelated gait commands. A fake-clock regression also exercises the C++
example's nominal `1.0 rad/s`/`3 rad` phase and locks the cross-command order,
while retaining state-confirmed stand/sit and bounded cleanup.

See the Robot repository's `YAW_CIRCLE_TEST_GUIDE.md` before manual use. The
wrapper requires `--confirm-physical-yaw-circle`, and no package manifest
launches it. This direct SDK test still does not create a Robonix `twist_in`
subscriber.

All state sources pass through one telemetry boundary that rejects malformed
dimensions, non-finite values, invalid timestamps and zero-norm quaternions;
valid non-unit odometry/IMU quaternions are normalized before publication.

To create a bounded normalized recording once hardware is available:

```bash
bash scripts/record-sdk-replay.sh /path/to/the-wheel /path/to/capture.jsonl \
  --robot-ip 10.21.20.1 --duration-s 30
```

The recorder is read-only, refuses to overwrite an existing file, disconnects
in `finally`, and prints an audit report covering rate, event gaps, timestamp
duplicates/regressions, disconnects and estimated missing odometry frames.

## State replay profile

`package_manifest.state-replay.yaml` forces `backend=replay` and declares only
`odom`. The bundled synthetic fixture can exercise the production Robonix/ROS
publication path without the wheel or robot:

```bash
cd ../robot-mirrorme-bpx
bash scripts/test-offline-integration.sh /path/to/fixed/robonix replay
```

This test performs Driver DEACTIVATE/ACTIVATE, receives `/odom` and
`/joint_states` plus `odom -> base_link`, checks the single-publisher topology,
and verifies shutdown cleanup. The fake variant also publishes a non-planar
Twist and requires the provider to reject it.

For the integrated SDK runtime, supply the same pinned wheel as an external
host artifact. The default and x86 Docker release manifests select the guarded
posture wrapper. It verifies the recorded SHA-256, mounts that one file
read-only, and installs it without contacting a package index:

```bash
export BPX_SDK_WHEEL=/absolute/path/to/bpx_sdk_open-1.0.8-cp310-cp310-manylinux_2_24_x86_64.manylinux_2_28_x86_64.whl
rbnx start -p . --set backend=sdk --set allow_motion=true \
  --set enable_posture_service=true
```

For normal deployment, use the Robot package's
`robonix_manifest.yaml` profile. Use `robonix_manifest.sdk-read-only.yaml` when
posture must be unavailable. Hardware activation remains bounded by
`sdk_connect_timeout_s` and fails if no fresh odometry frame arrives.

## Robonix build and start

Once `rbnx` is installed and configured against a fixed Robonix source tree:

```bash
rbnx validate .
rbnx build -p .
export BPX_SDK_WHEEL=/absolute/path/to/the-pinned-wheel
rbnx start -p . --config ./local-config.yaml \
  --set backend=sdk --set allow_motion=true \
  --set enable_posture_service=true
```

For a fake, motion-disabled development smoke test without hardware, explicitly
select the non-release identity:

```bash
rbnx start -p . --manifest package_manifest.motion-dev.yaml \
  --set backend=fake --set allow_motion=false
```

For standalone `rbnx start`, the wrapper defaults `RBNX_INSTANCE_NAME` to the
manifest package name, `robonix.primitive.mirrorme.bpx.quadruped`. An instance
name supplied by a deployment remains authoritative.

To validate and generate against the fixed Robonix source entirely in Docker:

```bash
bash scripts/verify-rbnx.sh /path/to/robonix
```

The script checks the expected Robonix commit and recorded interface submodule
commits, builds `rbnx` in a pinned Rust image, and uses the `grpcio-tools`
versions from that Robonix lockfile. All tool caches stay under `.artifacts/`.

The start wrapper bind-mounts the package and `robonix-api` into the container.
When `BPX_SDK_WHEEL` is set, it additionally verifies the pinned artifact and
bind-mounts only that wheel under `/vendor-sdk` with `:ro`. The artifact remains
outside the repository and runtime image so the release can preserve its own
Apache-2.0 LICENSE, NOTICE, third-party notices, checksum, and SBOM boundary.

The fixed-baseline test suite currently passes all 102 package tests. The
previous Atlas lifecycle smoke test used the distinct fake motion-development
identity: it reached `ACTIVE` with Driver, `twist_in`, and `odom`; its internal
`/joint_states` stream was consumed by ROS 2 `robot_state_publisher` to resolve
all four toe TF chains. Driver `CMD_SHUTDOWN` transitioned it to `TERMINATED`
without leaving a runtime container behind.

## Development status

See the workspace-level `TODO.md`. The published package can read state and
perform only explicit `stand`/`sit`; it cannot accept a velocity command. Do
not promote the motion-development identity or use its Twist path with a real
robot until the controlled-motion milestone and hardware checklist are complete.
